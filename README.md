### Firebase Structure

Firebase data types:
https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/data-types

**User Collection:**

There will be a user collection that stores general user information along with a sub-collection of user locations.

**Fields:**
>- first : string
>- last : string 
>- email : string
>- registered : date
>- avatar: reference (cloud firestore reference)
>- locations : sub-collection

___Example Json___:
```json
{
    first: joe,
    last: smith,
    email: joe.smith@gmail.com,
    registered: October 24, 2018 at 12:00:00 AM UTC-5,
    locations: sub-collection of locations
    groups : sub-collection of group_ids
}
```
**User Locations Collection:**

Each user will have their own collection of locations that stores a location along with a category of the type of location.

**Fields:**
>- location : geoPoint
>- stamp : dateTime 
>- type : string

___Example___:
```json
{
    location: [33.93874° N, 122.29837° W],
    stamp: October 24, 2018 at 12:00:00 AM UTC-5,
    type: [geotag, checkin, favorite, home, etc.]
}
```

**Location Types Collection:**

A list of location types with descriptions.

**Fields:**
>- location-type : string
>- description : string 
>- date-created: dateTime
>- creator-id: string

___Example___:
```json
{
    location-type: favorite,
    description: "A favorite location that you frequent often.",
    date-created: October 24, 2018 at 12:00:00 AM UTC-5,
    creator-id : 0239hu23jhv4

}
```
