#### 3) Routing / Location Based Services Team

- A google geo-location service wrapper that provides basic geo location functionality preferably as a service but the customer will be ok if the geo-location services are not fully decoupled from the views.

- **Resources:**
    - https://github.com/mapsplugin/ionic-map-provider-example (map as a service)
    - https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native-google-maps/tree/master/documents
    - https://codeburst.io/native-google-maps-and-geolocation-ionic-fe635a00249d
- **Map Visualization Service:**
    - Obtain routes between points
    - Show nearby locations (restaurants) (wish list)
    - Calculate Distance and Routes between:
        - user and user
        - user and group
        - user and location
        - Routes are not saved, but are displayed to the user.
    - GeoCoding - (address => lat/lon)
    - Reverse GeoCoding (lat/lon => address)
    - Addresses may be stored in Firebase with locations with Lat/Lon
- **Views / Components:**
    - Use the service previously defined to obtain locations and routes and display them on some map. 
    - Routing (directions) between places can be done by leaving the app and starting the local routing app from the phone (google maps, apple maps, etc.).

- This group will use the backend created by the firebase group. 
- Views:
    - One will give the user the ability to take a photo, add tags.
